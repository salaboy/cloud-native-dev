# Challenge 2 :: Cloud Native Applications Persistence
Welcome to Challenge 2 of our Cloud Native Applications series! 

In this challenge, we will extend the application from [Challenge 1](https://github.com/salaboy/cloud-native-dev/tree/main/1) to store its data using two different approaches: file system storage and SQL database storage.

## Objectives

1. **File System Storage (Branch: fs):**

Create a branch (called `fs` or `filesystem`) from the `main` branch and store the list of texts saved into a file (using the file system APIs provided by your programming language of choice). Ensure the application can read from this file to retrieve previously saved texts.

2. **SQL Database Storage (Branch: sql):**

- Create a branch (called `sql`), set up a SQL database of your choice, and store the list of texts in a table inside the database. Recommended PostgreSQL, but you can choose any SQL database that you want.
- Modify the application to save texts into this database table.
- Implement functionality to retrieve texts from the database.


## Deliverables 

- **Repository Setup:**
Create a new directory named `challenge-2`. Copy the application code from Challenge 1 into this directory and push it to your GitHub repository.

- **Branch Management:**
Create two branches from your main repository:
    - Branch fs (File System): Implement file system storage.
    - Branch sql: Implement SQL database storage.
 
Please ensure that both branches have fully functional applications and that everything is pushed to your GitHub repository. 

- **README.md:**
Create a README.md to explain how to run both application versions locally by switching branches. Include setup instructions for the file system storage (reading/writing files) and SQL database setup (creating tables, configuring connection).

Ensure all branches contain fully functional applications and that all code and instructions are pushed to your GitHub repository.

## Important Lessons Learned
By completing Challenge 2, you will gain practical experience and insights into key aspects of cloud-native application persistence:

- **Persistence Strategies:** Understand different approaches to data persistence, including file system and database storage, and their respective advantages and use cases.

- **Database Management:** Learn basic SQL skills, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data, essential for managing data in relational databases.

- **Version Control:** Practice using Git branches to manage different versions of your application, facilitating parallel development and experimentation with different storage mechanisms.

- **Dependency Management:** Handle dependencies specific to your programming language and database system, ensuring compatibility and seamless integration.
