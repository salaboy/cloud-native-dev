#Â Challenge 4 :: Cloud Native Applications on Kubernetes (Intermediate)

So far, you have run all the application services locally. The next step is to deploy your application services into a Kubernetes Cluster. 
This can be a remote cluster or a local cluster using KinD. To get this working you will need to create all the Kubernetes deployment descriptors for your application to run. 
You will also need to figure out how to get the containers into your cluster. 

Finally, you should validate that all services of the application are working and can be accessed from outside the cluster.
